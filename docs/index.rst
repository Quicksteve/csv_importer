   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to CSV Importer's documentation!
========================================

Contents: **CSV importer** is a tool which allow you to transform easily a csv file into a python object or a django model instance.
It is based on a django-style declarative model.

   :maxdepth: 2

Installation
------------

Simple, like Pypi package:

easy_install csvImporter

or with Pip

pip install csvImporter


Basic sample
------------

Here is a basic sample:

>>> class MyCsvModel(CsvModel):
>>>    name = CharField()
>>>    age = IntegerField()
>>>    length = FloatField()
>>> 
>>>    class Meta:
>>>        delimiter = ";"

You declare a MyCsvModel which will match to a csv file like this:
"Anthony;27;1.75"

To import the file or any iterable object, just do:

>>> my_csv_list = MyCsvModel.import_data(data = open("my_csv_file_name.csv"))
>>> first_line = my_csv_list[0]
>>> first_line.age
27

Without an explicit declaration, data and columns are matched in the same order:

- Anthony --> Column 0 --> Field 0 --> name
- 27      --> Column 1 --> Field 1 --> age
- 1.75    --> Column 2 --> Field 2 --> length

Django Model
------------

If you now want to interact with a django model, you just have to add a **dbModel** option to the class meta.

>>> from model import CsvModel
>>>
>>> class MyCSvModel(CsvModel):
>>>    name = CharField()
>>>    age = IntegerField()
>>>    length = FloatField()
>>>
>>>    class Meta:
>>>        delimiter = ";"
>>>        dbModel = Person

That will automatically match to the following django model.

>>> class Person(models.Model):
>>>    name = CharField(max_length = 100)
>>>    age = IntegerField()
>>>    length = FloatField()

If field names of your Csv model does not match the field names of your django model, you can manage this with the match keyword:

>>> class MyCSvModel(CsvModel):
>>>    fullname = CharField(match = "name")
...

If you don't want to have to re-declare a CSV model whereas the Django model already exist, use a CsvDbModel.

>>> from my_projects.models import Person
>>> from csvImporter.model import CsvDbModel
>>>
>>> class MyCsvModel(CsvDbModel):
>>>
>>>     class Meta:
>>>        dbModel = Person
>>>        delimiter = ";"

*The django model should be imported in the model*

Fields
------

Fields available are:

- **IntegerField** : return an int
- **FloatField** : return a float
- **CharField** : return a string
- **ForeignKey** : return a django model object
- **IgnoredField** : skip the value
- **ComposedKeyForeign** : return a django model object retrieve with multiple values as keys.
- **BooleanField** : return a boolean

Options :

You can give, as argument, the following options:

`row_num`
	define the position in the file for this field.
	
`match`
	define the django model name matching this field.
	If a list is defined, all the field matching will received the 		value.

`transform`
	Apply the function before returning the result.
	
`prepare`
	Apply the function on the raw value (still a string).

`validator`
	A class which should implement a validate function:
	def validate(self, value):  and return a Boolean. 
	This allow to apply some business validation on the object before uploading.

`multiple`
    Allow a field to read as many values as the number of remaining data on the line.
    
`keys`
	A list of fields which composed the key. Only for **ComposedKeyForeign**.
	
`is_true`
	a function which determine when a boolean is True. Only for **BooleanField**.
    
Here is an example of a way to use the transform attribute.

>>> class MyCsvModel(CsvModel):
>>>
>>>     user  = ForeignKey(transform = lambda user: user.username)

ForeignKey has an additional argument: 

`pk` 
	allow you to define on which value the object will be retrieved.

You can also skip a row during ``prepare``, ``transform`` or in a ``validator`` by raising a SkipRow exception.

Meta options
------------

`delimiter`
    define the delimiter of the csv file.
    If you do not set one, the sniffer will try yo find one itself.

`has_header`
    Skip the first line if True.

`dbModel`
    If defined, the importer will create an instance of this model.

`silent_failure`
    If set to True, an error in a imported line will not stop the loading.

`exclude`
    CsvDbModel only. To do take into account the django field of the django model defined in this list.

`layout`
    Set it to LinearLayout ( by default ) or Tabular Layout. Modify the way your data are organised in.22
    the file. Tabular read:
        B1  B2  B3
    A1  C1  C2  C3
    A2  C4  C5  C6    --> (A1,B1,C1), (A1,B2,C2), (A1,B3,C3), (A2,B1,C4) ...
    A3  C7  C8  C9
    
`update`
	Set as a dictionnary with the 'keys' value defining the list of 'natural keys'.
	If the value is found, update instead of creating a new object.
	If the value is not found, create a new object.


Importer option
---------------

When importing data, you can add an optional argument `extra_fields` which is a string or a list.
This allow to add a value to any line of the csv file before the loading.


Grouped CSV
-----------

If you want to create more than object by line, you should use a group CSV model.
This object will create the object in the same order than the csv_models attribute provided.

`csv_models`
	list of csv model, processed in the same order than the list
